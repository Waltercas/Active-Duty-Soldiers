# Active Duty Soldiers

## Background

The US Military is a constantly evolving organization with changing ideals. The Army's view in recent history is one that is focused on individuals.  Forget technology, vehicles, aircraft and weapons, Soldiers are the Army's most valuable asset. Without individuals that are willing to serve all the expensive pieces of equipment are left with nobody to man them. 

Soldiers have different needs and there are different factors that determine those differences. Factors that determine soldier's needs include age, gender and marital status to name a few. In this project I will be looking specifically at marital status in service members of all branches.  Marital status is important to know as leaders to better accommodate both single and married service members. Single and married soldiers have different needs but its important to fulfill those needs for both equally. Married soldiers require services like childcare, family counseling and other services that single soldiers don't. Single soldiers require different services like recreation and barracks housing.    



## Data

The data frame that I used for this project was sourced from Data.gov created in 2010.  In the data frame are active duty service members sorted by rank and marital status.  There was no missing data or nan's in the data frame.
